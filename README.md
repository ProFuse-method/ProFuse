### Our Works
Logic synthesis tools play as domain-specific compilers for hardware description languages (HDLs). These tools translate high-level circuit designs written by HDLs (e.g., Verilog) into actual hardware implementations, which are essential in bridging the gap between abstract design and physical hardware.
However, the quality assurance for logic synthesis tools is challenging. Current testing methods often use a large number of test programs to detect a small number of faults in these tools, leading to low testing efficiency.
Test program prioritization is an effective method to accelerate software testing by prioritizing the execution of test programs that are more likely to uncover faults.
However, due to the unique characteristics of circuit descriptions, existing test program prioritization methods struggle to handle the features of circuits described in HDLs, making them unsuitable for analyzing logic synthesis tools.
Therefore, we propose ProFuse, a multi-dimensional feature fusion-based method, to effective prioritize test program for logic synthesis tools testing. 
Verilog is one of the most commonly used HDLs, so we focused on it for this study.
Initially, ProFuse uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and Data Flow Graphs (DFG) to extract novel syntactic and structure features dedicated for HDL programs (e.g., Verilog), capturing comprehensive semantic and data flow information.
Next, ProFuse designs a joint model using both Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively parse these two types of features for accurate fault prediction.
Finally, a sorting component is utilized to rank all test programs for optimizing the test sequence.
Experimental results demonstrate that ProFuse achieves a significant Average Percentage of Fault Detection (APFD) score of 0.9285, outperforming baselines by 9.37\% to 94.75\%.
ProFuse can also be used in practical scenarios.
We use ProFuse to prioritize programs generated by a Verilog test programs generator.
Using ProFuse, we find 15 new and confirmed faults in two typical logic synthesis tools (i.e., Vivado and Yosys) within two months. In contrast, random testing without prioritization uncovered only one fault in the same time frame, which highlights the significant efficiency gains achieved through ProFuse.

### Main File
Our methodology is located in the 'method' directory:

1.The "LoSyTe_method" directory features our proposed LoSyTe algorithm's implementation, which includes:

(1)LoSyTe.py: The main function and the first component (Configuration selection component) for dynamic parameter configuration acquisition.
(2)get_reward.py: Evaluates each round's parameter configuration, incorporating the second (Test-program vectorization component) and third components (Equivalence checking component).
(3)get_feature.py: Calculates feature vectors for each test program.
(4)get_faults_number.py: Counts the number of faults discovered in the test programs generated each round.
(5)config.toml and config_update.py: config.toml is the parameter configuration file, and config_update.py updates this file with the latest parameter configuration combinations after each round.

2.The "Baseline" folder:

Contains the implementation of the five comparison algorithms used in this study: Default, Swarm, HIS, RECORD, and MCS.

3.The "Faults" folder:

Includes the defects discovered in the Vivado and Yosys logic synthesis tools. Each error file comes with a fault_description.pdf detailing the conditions that trigger the fault and an explanation of the error.
